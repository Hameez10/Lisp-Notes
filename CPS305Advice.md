If you are a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan Univeristy (TMU), like me, you will have to take CPS305 - Data Structures at some point during your time at TMU. You need to pass this course to be able to take upp-level courses that explore more complex areas of Computer Science. In past years, it has been taught in Lisp amongst others. 

Learning Lisp can be a difficult task. It is very different than any of the other lanaguges you have learnt in the past; Python, Java, Assembly code, and Machine code. The CS community here at TMU have described the languages as a game of count the brackets, due to there being so many and often times the reason behind code not functioning.

Approaching Lisp is no different from learning any other language – practice is key. When I began my journey with Lisp, I initially relied on reading lecture slides and making annotations, thinking I was making progress. However, true comfort with Lisp only came when I actively engaged in coding exercises.

In the initial weeks of CPS305, brace yourself for a crash course in Lisp. It might feel overwhelming, but with dedication, it's a manageable amount of information. The first two labs might be challenging, but don't be discouraged – the learning curve becomes more manageable as you immerse yourself in the language.

Consider a focused effort on Lisp in the early weeks of the course, as this foundation will prove crucial during midterms. Grind through practice problems and, importantly, refer to the study guide – especially if Dr. Santos is your instructor. The study guide is your key to success in the exams.
