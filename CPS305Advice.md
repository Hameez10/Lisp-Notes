If you are a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan Univeristy (TMU), like me, you will have to take CPS305 - Data Structures at some point during your time at TMU. You need to pass this course to be able to take upp-level courses that explore more complex areas of Computer Science. In past years, it has been taught in Lisp amongst others. 

Learning Lisp can be a difficult task. It is very different than any of the other lanaguges you have learnt in the past; Python, Java, Assembly code, and Machine code. The CS community here at TMU have described the languages as a game of count the brackets, due to there being so many and often times the reason behind code not functioning.
