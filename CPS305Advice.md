If you are a Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan Univeristy (TMU), like me, you will have to take CPS305 - Data Structures at some point during your time at TMU. You need to pass this course to be able to take upp-level courses that explore more complex areas of Computer Science. In past years, it has been taught in Lisp amongst others. 

Learning Lisp can be a difficult task. It is very different than any of the other lanaguges you have learnt in the past; Python, Java, Assembly code, and Machine code. The CS community here at TMU have described the languages as a game of count the brackets, due to there being so many and often times the reason behind code not functioning.

The method of learning Lisp is the same as any other langauge however. You can only understand it by practiciing. When I started leanring Lisp, I woudl just read of the elcutre slides. i thougt I was mking good progress adding annotations besides the lsides, but I wasnt at my best. I only became comfortable in Lisp when I started coding it. 

The first few weeks of the course you will doing a crash course on Lisp. It is going to be a lto fo information, but an acheivable ampunt of you put in the work. The first 2 labs will eb difficult, but after that you will get the hang of it. You really want to grind Lisp until reading week as that will be the basics of the midterms. PLEASE READ THE STIDY GUIDE as that is all you need to do well on the exams (applies if you have Dr. Santos).
